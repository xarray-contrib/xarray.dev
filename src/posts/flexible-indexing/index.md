summary: 'It is now possible to take full advantage of coordinate data via Xarray explicit and flexible indexes'
---

_TLDR: Xarray>2025.6 has been through a major refactoring of its internals that makes coordinate-based data selection and alignment customizable, enabling more efficient handling of both traditional and more exotic data structures! In this post we highlight a few examples that take advantage of this new superpower. If you're interested in this topic, also check out Deepak Cherian's [2025 SciPy Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-NHCuLhRjY) and [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sQU2N0-ThNZM8TUhsZy-kT0bZnu0H5X0FRJz2eKwEpA/edit?slide=id.g37373ba88e6_0_214#slide=id.g37373ba88e6_0_214)!_

# Exciting new ways to slice and dice your data with Xarray!

First thing's first, _what is an `index` and why is it helpful?_

> An _index_ makes repeated subsetting and selection of data more efficient.

Examples of indexes are all around you and are a fundamental way to organize and simplify access to information.
If you want a book about Natural Sciences, you can go to your local library branch and head straight to section `500`.
Or if you're in the mood for a good novel go to section `800` thanks to the Dewey Decimal System [(credit to Dewey, 1876)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification)!

Some indexes are less universal and more multi-dimensional: In my local grocery store I know that aisle 12, top shelf has the best cereal.
And the second shelf on aisle 1 has the yogurt. In this example, _aisles 1-12 and shelves 1-5 are the coordinates_ of our grocery, but the more infomative _aisle content labels_ are the indexes.
Once you've mentally asigned labels to your grocery, you can get what you want quickly without needing to wander around!

The same efficiencies arise in computing. Consider a simple 1D dataset consisting of measurements `Y=[10,20,30,40,50,60]` at six positions `X=[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]`. _What was our measurement at `X=8`?_

To extract the answer in code we can loop over _all_ the values of `X` to find `X=8`. In Python conventions we find it at position 3, then use that to get our answer `Y[3]=40`.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**
> With only 6 coordinates, we easily see `X[3]=8`, but for large datasets we should loop over _all_ the coordinates to ensure there are no repeated values!
> This initial pass over all the coordinates to build an _index_ takes some time and may not always be desireable.

## Pandas.Index

In the example above the index is simply a key:value mapping between the coordinate values and integer positions `i=[0,1,2,3,4,5]` in the coordinates array.
This in fact is the default [Pandas.Index](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/indexing.html)! And this is what Xarray has exclusively used until now to power [label-based selection](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/indexing.html#indexing-with-dimension-names):

```python
# NOTE Xarray builds a "PandasIndex" for coordinate 'x' by default
x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32])
y = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
da = xr.DataArray(y, coords={'x': x})
da
```

<RawHTML filePath='/posts/flexible-indexing/da-pandas-repr.html' />

```python
da.sel(x=3)
# 40
```

## Alternatives to Pandas.Index

Importantly, a loop over all the coordinate values is not the only way to create an index.
You might recognize that our coordinates about can in fact be represented by a function `X(i)=2**i` where `i` is the integer position! Given that information we can quickly get measurement values at any poisition: `Y(X=4)` = `Y[sqrt(4)]` = `Y[2]=30`. Xarray now has a [`CoordinateTransformIndex`](https://xarray-indexes.readthedocs.io/blocks/transform.html) to handle this on-demand lookup of coordinate positions.

### Xarray RangeIndex

A simple special case of `CoordinateTransformIndex` is a `RangeIndex` where coordinates are even simplier and can be definied by a start, stop, and uniform step size. `Pandas.RangeIndex` only supports _integers_, whereas Xarray handles floating-point values. Coordinate look-up is performed on-the-fly rather than loading all values into memory up-front when creating a Dataset, which is critical for the example below that has a coordinate array of 7TB!

```python
from xarray.indexes import RangeIndex

index = RangeIndex.arange(0.0, 1000.0, 1e-9, dim='x') # 7TB coordinate array
ds = xr.Dataset(coords=xr.Coordinates.from_xindex(index))
ds
```

<RawHTML filePath='/posts/flexible-indexing/ds-range-repr.html' />

```
sliced = ds.isel(x=slice(1_000, 50_000, 100))
sliced.x
```

<RawHTML filePath='/posts/flexible-indexing/ds-range-slice-repr.html' />

### Xarray NDPointIndex

TODO

## Third-party custom Indexes

A lot of work over the last several years has gone into the nuts and bolts of Xarray to make it possible to plug in new Indexes. Here we'll highlight a few examples!

### XProj CRSIndex

> real-world datasets are usually more than just raw numbers; they have labels which encode information about how the array values map to locations in space, time, etc. [Xarray Docs](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/getting-started-guide/why-xarray.html#what-labels-enable)

We often think about metadata providing context for _measurement values_ but metadata is also critical for coordinates!
In particular, to align two different datasets we must ask if the coordinates are in the same coordinate system.
In other words, do they share the same origin and scale?

There are currently over 7000 commonly used [Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/) for geospatial data in the authoritative EPSG database!
And of course an infinite number of custom-defined CRSs.
[xproj.CRSIndex](https://xproj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) gives Xarray objects an automatic awareness of the coordinate reference system operations like `xr.align()` no longer succeed when they should raise an error:

```python
from xproj import CRSIndex
lons1 = np.arange(-125, -120, 1)
lons2 = np.arange(-122, -118, 1)
ds1 = xr.Dataset(coords={'longitude': lons1}).proj.assign_crs(crs=4267)
ds2 = xr.Dataset(coords={'longitude': lons2}).proj.assign_crs(crs=4326)
ds1 + ds2
```

```pytb
MergeError: conflicting values/indexes on objects to be combined for coordinate 'crs'
```

### Rasterix RasterIndex

Earlier we mentioned that coordinates often have a _functional representation_.
For 2D geospatial raster images, this function often takes the form of an [Affine Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation).
This how the [rasterix RasterIndex](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/rasterix) computes coordinates rather than storing them all in memory.
Also alignment by comparing transforms minimizes common errors due to floating point mismatches.

Below is a simple example of slicing a large mosaic of GeoTiffs without ever loading the coordiantes into memory, note that a new Affine is defined after the slicing operation:

```python
# 811816322401 values!
import rasterix

#26475 GeoTiffs represented by a GDAL VRT
da = xr.open_dataarray('https://opentopography.s3.sdsc.edu/raster/COP30/COP30_hh.vrt',
                       engine='rasterio',
                       parse_coordinates=False).squeeze().pipe(
    rasterix.assign_index
)
da
```

<RawHTML filePath='/posts/flexible-indexing/da-rasterix-repr.html' />

```python
print('Original geotransform:\n', da.xindexes['x'].transform())
da_sliced = da.sel(x=slice(-122.4, -120.0), y=slice(-47.1,-49.0))
print('Sliced geotransform:\n', da_sliced.xindexes['x'].transform())
```

```
Original geotransform:
 | 0.00, 0.00,-180.00|
| 0.00,-0.00, 84.00|
| 0.00, 0.00, 1.00|
Sliced geotransform:
 | 0.00, 0.00,-122.40|
| 0.00,-0.00,-47.10|
| 0.00, 0.00, 1.00|
```

### XVec GeometryIndex

A "vector data cube" is an n-D array that has at least one dimension indexed by a 2-D array of vector geometries.
Large vector cubes can take advantage of an [R-tree spatial index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) for efficiently selecting vector geometries within a given bounding box.
The `XVec.GeometryIndex` provides this functionality, below is a short code snippet but please refer to the [documentation for more](https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indexing.html)!

```python
import xvec
import geopandas as gpd
from geodatasets import get_path

# Dataset that contains demographic data indexed by U.S. counties
counties = gpd.read_file(get_path("geoda.natregimes"))

cube = xr.Dataset(
    data_vars=dict(
        population=(["county", "year"], counties[["PO60", "PO70", "PO80", "PO90"]]),
        unemployment=(["county", "year"], counties[["UE60", "UE70", "UE80", "UE90"]]),
    ),
    coords=dict(county=counties.geometry, year=[1960, 1970, 1980, 1990]),
).xvec.set_geom_indexes("county", crs=counties.crs)
cube
```

<RawHTML filePath='/posts/flexible-indexing/xvec-repr.html' />

```python
# Efficient selection using shapely.STRtree
from shapely.geometry import box

subset = cube.xvec.query(
    "county",
    box(-125.4, 40, -120.0, 50),
    predicate="intersects",
)

subset['population'].xvec.plot(col='year');
```
