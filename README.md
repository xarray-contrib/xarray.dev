## Authoring blog post tips

1. To create a new blog post a good place to start is copying a subfolder under `src/posts/`, so, for example https://xarray.dev/blog/flox is written here https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray.dev/blob/e04905f5ea039eb2eb848c0b4945beee323900e4/src/posts/flox/index.md

### Static assets

Once you have `src/posts/newpost/index.md` start writing! If you want to include figures or other static assets, they go into a matching `public/posts/newpost` folder. But! reference an images without the `public` part of the path like this:

```html
<p align="center">
  <img src="/posts/newpost/figure.png" />
</p>
```

### Xarray HTML reprs

To include an html repr, you must save it first:

```python
with open('da-repr.html', 'w') as f:
   f.write(da._repr_html_())
```

Then put it into the post's static assets folder `public/posts/newpost/da-repr.html`. And finally in `src/posts/newpost/index.md` you can include it with this syntax:

```
<RawHTML filePath='/posts/newpost/da-repr.html' />
```

### Toggling visibilty of sections (markdown comments)

While authoring, you might want to toggle specific sections on and off during rendering. You can do that with this syntax:

```
{/* This is a comment that won't be rendered! */}
```

### Landing page banner

If you'd like to add a link to the latest blog post on the landing page banner, edit this section here:
